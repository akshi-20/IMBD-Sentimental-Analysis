## 🌟 Overview

**IMBD Sentimental Analysis** is a machine learning project that performs **sentiment analysis** on movie reviews from the [IMDB dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). Using a **pre-trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**, it classifies reviews as **Positive** 😊 or **Negative** 😞, providing insights into public opinion on movies. The project features an interactive **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Pre-trained RNN Model**: High-accuracy sentiment prediction for IMDB reviews.
- 🌐 **Interactive Streamlit App**: Input reviews and get instant sentiment results.
- 📦 **Ready-to-Use Model**: Includes `simple_rnn_imdb.h5` for quick deployment.
- ✅ **Clear Feedback**: Positive reviews marked with ✅, negative with ❌.
- ✍️ **Custom Review Support**: Test your own movie reviews with ease.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshi-20/IMBD-Sentimental-Analysis.git
cd IMBD-Sentimental-Analysis
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Requirements**: Python 3.8+, TensorFlow, Streamlit, NumPy, Pandas

---

## 🚀 Usage

Launch the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

**How to Use**:

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Enter a movie review in the text area.
3. Click **Classify** to get the sentiment prediction.
4. View the results:
   - **Sentiment**: Positive 😊 or Negative 😞
   - **Prediction Score**: Probability of positive sentiment
